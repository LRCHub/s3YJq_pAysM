The weight of my words is not enough to make up for the words I didn't say
I'm sorry - didn't wan't to close the door
Just afraid to suffocate inside this these arms where i'll find comfort
I will try not to break another mirror because that would be that I only break myself
My eyes have never felt so soar - if I had only known more
Self centered - myself to blame - death is fucking you insane
A selfish boy with fear and doubt afraid to let it inside
I promised myself that I wouldn't break it another time
No questions asked through all the time - just answers taken
My guilt - my thoughts - my mind
Where - who's to judge?
I think I need to breath - let the door be open
The only one who is choking me is myself
Why can't I see that you are the sun - the rain - the fuel I need inside
Why can't I see?
I will try
I won't listen
I will cry
Sunflower princess
I won't listen
I will cry
Sunflower princess
I won't listen
I will cry
Sunflower princess
I won't listen
I will cry
Sunflower princess
