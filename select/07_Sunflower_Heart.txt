Sunflower, blooming in your finest hour
You have come into your power
And you spill it over me

Such petals, standing shameless in the air
Catch the eyes of other lovers
With the colors that you wear

I have only seen you grow
From the seed I used to know
In the burning breath of summer
The garden's afterglow

Sunflower, just the way you speak my name
I will never be the same, oh yeah
Sunflower, never steal your eyes away
Even when the seasons change
A little sun, a little rain

I have only seen you grow
From the seed I used to know
In the burning breath of summer
And the garden's afterglow

Sunflower, a little sun, a little rain
Even when the seasons change
Sunflower, even when the seasons change
A little sun, a little rain
