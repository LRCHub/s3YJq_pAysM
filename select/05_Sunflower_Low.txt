when they found your body
giant X's on your eyes
with your half of the ransom
you bought some sweet, sweet, sweet
sweet sunflowers
and gave them to the night
underneath the star of david
a hundred years behind my eyes
and with my half of the ransom
i bought some sweet, sweet, sweet
sweet sunflowers
and gave them to the night
sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet sunflowers x 4
and gave them to the night
